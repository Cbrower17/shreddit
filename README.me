An overambitious clone of Reddit. 
I don't know enough to make this work super well but thats all good.
i want to have:
- a pseudo log in
- POST new posts
- add comments
- "follow" users
- filter post user to fit your feed
- edit a profile
- remove your own comments
- remove your own posts
- search for posts/users
- use routes for individual pages
- have post categories
- filter posts by categories
